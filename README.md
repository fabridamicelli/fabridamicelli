### Hi! 👋

I'm Fabrizio, currently a 🎓 PhD Student in 🖥️ Computational Neuroscience 🧠.  \
My work so far has been about brain networks, how they come about 🔭 and what they might be good for (besides researchers generating pretty pictures 😁). \
I am recently also interested in the cross-talk between biological and artificial neural networks, looking at biology to improve artificial systems and experimenting with artificial models to understand brain computation (check [this](https://fabridamicelli.github.io/blog/research/) for more details 🧐 on my research).
